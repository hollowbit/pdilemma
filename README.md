# Pdilemma

This is a basic Prisoner's Dilemma game, all played online with multiple clients! I started this project to learn how Elixir and Phoenix work.

## Planned Features

I'm not done learning yet! Here are some things I want to add to learn more:

- Private rooms: using custom and generated room codes
- Joining rooms mid-game doesn't cause issues
- Security: prevent players you don't want from join and interfering with your private room
- Nicer UI: It's very ugly right now (proof of concept)

## Try it yourself

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
