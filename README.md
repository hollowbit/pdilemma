# Pdilemma

This is a basic Prisoner's Dilemma game, all played online with multiple clients! I started this project to learn how Elixir and Phoenix work.

This repository is more of a sandbox so the code is not very nice or well designed. I plan on making a better designed version in the future in another project. This project is just to prototype an idea.

## Missing Features

Here are some things that have not been implemented, but can be to make it better:

- [ ] Kicking players: host can kick players when in lobby.

- [ ] Spectators: when players join late, they can spectate the game and join in the next round. Spectators can't be kicked.

- [ ] Anti-cheat: only let players see and change their own team's selections and not the other's.

## Try it yourself

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies: `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies: `cd assets && npm install`
  * Go back to root of project: `cd ..`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint: `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
